## Project One
### Project Name: Visual Question Answering
### Project Description:
```
Visual Question Answering (VQA) using machine learning techniques is an important field.  A person watching a scene does not only recognize objects (e.g., car, apple, tree, dog, etc.).  The person describes the scene.  For example, they will say:  it is a fast moving car or it is a car with three passengers or it is a car waiting on a stop sign for people to cross the street.
You are expected to research the problem, describe different approaches and explain use cases that will be solved with such technologies.  It is always better to define the user story then find the solution.  However, in this case, there are many applications that are need such technologies and it will be good if you can define the user story and how the technology will be applied.
It will be good to run some examples that have been posted as part of research papers or solution providers.  Your assessment of the solution will be of great value.
